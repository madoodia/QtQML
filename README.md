# QtQML
Learning more advanced topics in Qt, QML and C++ (Personal Setup)

## Setup
This repo is setuped very well for running on **QtCreator** and **MS VSCode**

- Using **clang-format**
- Using **CMake** for build system
- Nice Structure for Developing Softwares

### My Personal Taste
People usually use QtCreator but, I am very comfortable with Microsoft VSCode, so always I setup my environment to work in it.
